# Prompt Ops - AI Prompt Engineering Game

Prompt Ops is an interactive game designed to help users learn and master the art of prompt engineering. Players are challenged to reverse-engineer system prompts by observing AI conversations and crafting their own prompts to match the target behavior.

## Features

- ðŸŽ® Interactive learning experience
- ðŸŽ¯ Multiple levels with increasing complexity
- ðŸ’¡ Helpful hints and feedback
- ðŸ“Š Real-time similarity scoring
- ðŸ”„ Instant AI response testing
- ðŸŽ‰ Progress tracking and completion rewards

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/detextit/promptops.git
cd promptops
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to start playing!

## How to Play

1. Each level presents you with a target conversation between a user and an AI
2. Your goal is to figure out the system prompt that generated the AI's response
3. Write your system prompt and test it
4. Get a similarity score of 50% or higher to reveal the target prompt
5. Progress through levels to master different prompt engineering techniques
