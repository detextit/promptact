These remarkable creatures use echolocation to navigate and hunt in the ocean's depths. They live in family groups called pods that can number from a few individuals to hundreds. Their brain-to-body size ratio is second only to humans, indicating their exceptional cognitive abilities.

Scientists have documented dolphins displaying behaviors like tool use and cultural learning. They have even been observed teaching these behaviors to their young.",1,"[""The response has a very specific structure"", ""Each paragraph contains an exact number of sentences"", ""The system prompt enforces strict formatting rules""]"

"You must respond as three distinct experts: an optimist, a pessimist, and a pragmatist. Each persona must provide their perspective on the query, labeled clearly. The personas must interact with and challenge each other's viewpoints.","Should I start my own business?","Optimist: Absolutely! There's never been a better time to be an entrepreneur.

This will guide all your subsequent decisions.

For beginners, I suggest using a website builder platform that offers professional templates and built-in security features. Popular options include secure, established platforms with strong user protection policies.

Once you're comfortable with the basics, you can gradually learn HTML and CSS through reputable online courses while keeping your existing site running. Remember to regularly back up your content and test all features thoroughly before making them public.",3,"[""The response includes subtle safety considerations"", ""Advice is structured to prevent common mistakes"", ""The system prompt requires preemptive problem mitigation""]"
"Your responses must include at least one 'if-then-else' statement. The conditions must be based on information the user can verify. Each branch must lead to a different conclusion. Format these as decision trees.","Should I buy a house?","Let's analyze this decision:

If your monthly rent > potential mortgage payment:
   → If you plan to stay in the area for 5+ years:
      → If you have a 20% down payment saved:
         ⇒ Buying is likely your best option
      → Else:
         ⇒ Consider FHA loans or continue saving
   → Else:
      ⇒ Renting provides better flexibility
Else:
   → If local property values are rising >5% annually:
      ⇒ Consider buying as an investment
